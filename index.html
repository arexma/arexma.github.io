			My Learning Plan
		</h2>
		<p align="center"><font size="4">
			My learning plan currently consists of absorbing knowledge from an app on my phone called <a href="https://sololearn.com"
			target="_blank"><b>SoloLearn</b></a> and taking
			notes/practicing with each respective language. As of right now, I am focusing on <b>Python</b> and <b>HTML</b> until I 
			finish the lessons. As of April 10th, 2019, I am learning about functional programming in Python and am beginning specified HTML-5 learning. I have also 
			lightly touched C++ lessons and will be approaching CSS and JavaScript in the near future to style this blog. It's looking dreary as it is right now 😅.

			My HTML Notes and Python Projects
		</h2>
		<p align="center"><font size="4">
			The following link is a Google drive containing <b>Python</b> projects as well as my current notes for both <b>Python</b> and <b>HTML</b>. I will add my 
			C++, CSS, and JavaScript notes/projects once I take up learning those languages. Hopefully these documents will inspire anyone who wishes to take up coding themselves 
			and convince them that no goal is too lofty.

			Planned Updates to this Blog
		</h2>
		<p align="center"><font size="4">
			Once I reach intermediate skill level with <b>Python</b> and <b>HTML</b>, I plan to begin simultaneously learning
			<b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> and incorporating the language into this blog to create a user-friendly and aesthetically
			pleasing website. As it is now, it hurts even my eyes to look at my own blog 😊.
