			My Learning Plan
		</h2>
		<p align="center"><font size="4">
			My learning plan currently consists of absorbing knowledge from an app on my phone called <a href="https://sololearn.com"
			target="_blank"><b>SoloLearn</b></a> and taking
			notes/practicing with each respective language. As of right now, I am focusing on <b>Python</b> and <b>HTML</b> until I 
			become adequately accustomed to each language.
		</font></p>
		<h2 align="center">
			My HTML Notes and Python Projects
		</h2>
		<p align="center"><font size="4">
			I will be linking several <b>Python</b> projects as well as my current notes for both <b>Python</b> and <b>HTML</b>. Hopefully
			this will inspire anyone who wishes to take up coding themselves and convince them that no goal is too 
			lofty.

			Planned Updates to this Blog
		</h2>
		<p align="center"><font size="4">
			Once I reach intermediate skill level with <b>Python</b> and <b>HTML</b>, I plan to begin simultaneously learning
			<b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> and incorporating the language into this blog to create a user-friendly and aesthetically
			pleasing website.
