			My Learning Plan
		</h2>
		<p align="center">
			My learning plan currently consists of absorbing knowledge from an app on my phone called SoloLearn and taking
			notes/practicing with each respective language. As of right now, I am focusing on Python and HTML until I 
			become adequately accustomed to each language.
		</p>
		<h2 align ="center">
			My HTML Notes and Python Projects
		</h2>
		<p align="center">
			I will be linking several Python projects as well as my current notes for both Python and HTML. Hopefully
			this will inspire anyone who wishes to take up coding themselves and convine them that no goal is too 
			lofty.

			pleasing website.
